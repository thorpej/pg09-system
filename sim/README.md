# 6809 Playground Logisim simulations

* pg09_clock_generator.circ -- Simulation of the clock generator.
* pg09_lbram_decode.circ -- Simulation of the Low Banked RAM bank decoding.
* pg09_from_brom_decode.circ -- Simulation of the Fixed / Banked ROM selector
  logic.
* pg09_addr_decode_stage1.circ -- Simulation of the first level of the
  address decoder.
  * **OBSOLETE: I decided to put the whole thing in a pair of GALs.**
* pg09_addr_decode_io_option1.circ -- Simulation of the second level of
  the address decoder, for the I/O space, option 1.
  * **OBSOLETE: I decided to put the whole thing in a pair of GALs.**
* pg09_addr_decode_io_option2.circ -- Simulation of the second level of
  the address decoder, for the I/O space, option 2.
