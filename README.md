# 6809 Playground

Welcome to my 6809 Playground!  This project is about building a general
purpose 8-bit computer based on the Motorola 6809 CPU.  While this is
definitely a retro-computer project, I'm not going to be dogmatic about
it -- modern gadgets that add value to the project will have a home here,
too.

The whole point of this exercise is to learn-by-doing and have fun in the
process.  I have a few ideas about how I want the project to go, but it
may veer this way or that as it progresses.  We'll see!

I invite you to follow along with this [YouTube playlist:](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_E3Je1H0xrvq1AOL1zlwj3LmrBiK8FJb).  As each
installment is posted, this README will be updated with additional information
about the that installment, including links to data sheets and a parts list.

If you learn something from this, if you decide to build one of these
yourself, or if it inspires you embark on a similar adventure on your own,
I would love to hear from you!

## 01 - Introduction

In the first installment, I briefly introduce the project and provide some
background.
